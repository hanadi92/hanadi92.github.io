:summary: Trying out Pelican SSG for my Github Page.

This is my first article of this fresh web-blog on Github Pages.
After some research, I decided to try Pelican as a static site generator. Since it is Python based, I thought maybe I could add more custom features later on.
The plan is to dump thoughts and experience in here, just for fun. Starting with setting up this project.

First I had to create a project dir and start a venv there:

.. code-block:: bash

   mkdir myproject
   cd myproject
   virtualenv venv
   source venv/bin/activate

Then basically install pelican via pip and create a boilerplate:

.. code-block:: bash

   python -m pip install pelican
   pelican-quickstart

The quickstart command will start an interrogation to create config for the makefile, make sure to say "yes" to the Github Pages option.
Makefile has all the required commands to generate and serve the site. Now I will push this to my Github Page and see how it goes!

Next, I will play around with themes then create the 404 and about pages.

Ciao!
